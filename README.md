Hello, world! I'm Benny, welcome back to my Github!

I'm currently enrolled in the fullstack program at <a href="https://www.nucamp.co/">Nucamp</a>!

I strive to become a web developer, leaning on front end design although I do find business and data logic intriging!
I'll continue to build my portfolio, so keep an eye on me because I want to bring value to whatever I do!
